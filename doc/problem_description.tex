\section{Problem specification}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Consider the unit interval $\Omega=[0,1]$. Let the function $f:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be fixed. For a given function $\alpha:\Omega\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, we want to find the function $u:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ which satisfies
\begin{equation}
    -\frac{d}{dx}\left(\exp[\alpha(x)]\frac{du}{dx}(x)\right) = f(x)\qquad\text{for all $0<x<1$}
    \label{eqn:PDE}
\end{equation}
subject to the boundary conditions 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    u(x=0) &=0 \qquad{\text{(homogeneous Dirichlet)}}\\
    \frac{du}{dx}(x=1) &=-g\exp[-\alpha(1)] \qquad{\text{(von Neumann)}}
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eqn:boundary_condition}
\end{equation}
In a more abstract sense, let $V$ be the space of real-valued functions defined on $\Omega$. We want to find the map $\mathcal{F} : V\rightarrow V$ with $\mathcal{F}:\alpha \mapsto u(\alpha)$ where $u=u(\alpha)$ is defined by \eqref{eqn:PDE} and \eqref{eqn:boundary_condition}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\paragraph{Physical interpretation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Note that by setting $K(x):=\exp[\alpha(x)]$, \eqref{eqn:PDE} can be written as $-\nabla\cdot (K\nabla u)=f$. So physically the problem is about finding the solution of the diffusion equation for a given spatially varying diffusion coefficient $K(x)>0$ which is parametrised by its logarithm $\alpha(x)$.

Imagine, for example, that $u$ is a temperature field. Then the heat flux is given by
\begin{equation}
    \phi = - K\nabla u
\end{equation}
where $K$ is the spatially varying thermal conductivity. If $f$ describes the sources and sinks of heat, then the (stationary) conservation law is
\begin{equation}
    \nabla \cdot \phi = f.
\end{equation}
The boundary conditions in \eqref{eqn:boundary_condition} correspond to fixing the temperature at $x=0$ and fixing the heat flux at $x=1$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Quantity of interest}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Usually we are not really interested in predicting $u(x)$ itself for a given $\alpha(x)$ but instead want to compute some functional $Q$ of $u(x)$
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{Q}: V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^\beta.\label{eqn:QoI}
\end{equation}
In other words, we are interested in the map $\mathcal{Q}\circ \mathcal{F}:V\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^\beta$. $\mathcal{Q}$ is also called the ``Quantity of Interest'' (short QoI). Some examples are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Average field ($\beta=1$):
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{Q}(u) = \int_\Omega u(x)\;dx
    \end{equation}
    \item Sampled field:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{Q}(u) = (u(\xi_1),u(\xi_2),\dots,u(\xi_\beta))
    \end{equation}
     for some sample points $\xi_1,\xi_2,\dots,\xi_\beta\in\Omega$.
    \item Higher moments of field:
    \begin{equation}
        \mathcal{Q}(u) = \left(\int_\Omega u(x)^{\nu_1}\;dx,\int_\Omega u(x)^{\nu_2}\;dx,\dots,\int_\Omega u(x)^{\nu_\beta}\;dx\right)
    \end{equation}
    for some powers $\nu_1,\nu_2,\dots,\nu_\beta\in\mathbb{N}$.
\end{itemize}
Note that $\mathcal{Q}$ is linear in the first two cases but non-linear in the last case.

\section{Discretisation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Let $\Omega = [0,1]$ be the unit interval. Split $\Omega$ into $n$ sub-intervals of size $h=1/n$ to obtain a grid \mbox{$\Omega_h := \bigcup_{j=0}^{n-1} I_j^{(h)}$} where $I_j^{(h)}=[jh,(j+1)h]=[x^{(h)}_j,x^{(h)}_{j+1}]$ for $j=0,1,\dots,n-1$ is the $j$-th sub-interval or cell of the grid. We call the points $x^{(h)}_j=jh$ for $j=0,1,\dots,n$ the vertices of the grid.

Let $\alpha^{(h)}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the vector with $\alpha^{(h)}_j\approx \alpha(x^{(h)}_j)$ and $u^{(h)}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be the vector with
\begin{equation}
    u^{(h)}_j\approx \frac{1}{h}\int_{I^{(h)}_j} u(x)\; dx\qquad\text{for $j=0,1,\dots,n-1$},\label{eqn:vol_avg}
\end{equation}
with an analogous definition of the vector $f^{(h)}\in \mathbb{R}^n$. The definition in \eqref{eqn:vol_avg} says that the components of the vector $u^{(h)}$ approximate the volume averages of the solution in the grid cells. To discretise \eqref{eqn:PDE} with the finite volume method, integrate the equation over cell $I_j^{(h)}$ and use the boundary conditions in \eqref{eqn:boundary_condition}:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
       hf^{(h)}_j :=\int_{I^{(h)}_j} f(x)\;dx&=
    -\int_{I^{(h)}_j} \frac{d}{dx}\left(\exp[\alpha(x)]\frac{du}{dx}(x)\right)\;dx \\
    &=h\left(\exp[\alpha(x^{(h)}_{j})]\frac{du}{dx}(x^{(h)}_{j})-\exp[\alpha(x^{(h)}_{j+1})]\frac{du}{dx}(x^{(h)}_{j+1})\right)\\
    &\approx \begin{cases}
        h\left(\exp[\alpha^{(h)}_{j}]\frac{2u^{(h)}_j}{h}-\exp[\alpha^{(h)}_{j+1}]\frac{u^{(h)}_{j+1}-u^{(h)}_j}{h}\right)&\text{for $j=0$}\\
        h\left(\exp[\alpha^{(h)}_{j}]\frac{u^{(h)}_j-u^{(h)}_{j-1}}{h}-\exp[\alpha^{(h)}_{j+1}]\frac{u^{(h)}_{j+1}-u^{(h)}_j}{h}\right)&\text{for $0<j<n-1$}\\ 
        h\left(\exp[\alpha^{(h)}_{j}]\frac{u^{(h)}_j-u^{(h)}_{j-1}}{h}+g\right)&\text{for $j=n-1$}
    \end{cases}
    \end{aligned}  
\end{equation}
This results in the following linear system:
\begin{equation}
A^{(h)} u^{(h)} = f^{(h)}-\delta^{(h)}\label{eqn:discrete_system}
\end{equation}
where $\delta^{(h)}=(0,0,\dots,0,g)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the vector which is zero everywhere except for its final entry. The matrix $A^{(h)} = A^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)})$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    A^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)}) =
    \begin{aligned}\frac{1}{h}
        \begin{pmatrix}
            2K_0 + K_1 & -K_1 & 0 & 0 & 0&\cdots & 0\\
            -K_1 & K_1 + K_2 & - K_2  & 0 &0& \cdots & 0\\
            0 & -K_2 & K_2 + K_3 & - K_3 & 0 & \cdots & 0\\
            0 & 0 & -K_3 & \ddots\\
            0&0&0&&&&\vdots\\
            \vdots & \vdots &\vdots&&\ddots &-K_{n-2} & 0\\
             &  &  & & -K_{n-2} &  K_{n-2} + K_{n-1} & -K_{n-1}\\
            0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots &0 &  -K_{n-1}  & K_{n-1}
        \end{pmatrix}
    \end{aligned}  
\end{equation}
where, for simplicity, we defined the diffusion coefficients as
\begin{equation}
    K_j^{(h)} = K_j^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)}_j):= \exp [\alpha_j^{(h)}].
\end{equation}
Note that by solving \eqref{eqn:discrete_system} for $u^{(h)}$ for a given $\alpha^{(h)}$ we can construct an approximation $\mathcal{F}_h$ of the map $\mathcal{F}_h$:
\begin{xalignat}{2}
    \mathcal{F}_h : \mathbb{R}^{n} &\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n,&
    \alpha^{(h)}&\mapsto u^{(h)} = u^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)})=\;\text{the solution of \eqref{eqn:discrete_system} for given $\alpha^{(h)}$.}
\end{xalignat}
We also need to construct an approximation $Q^{(h)}$ of the QoI in \eqref{eqn:QoI}. For example, if the QoI is the average field, then $Q^{(h)}:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
    Q^{(h)}(u^{(h)}) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}u^{(h)}_j.
\end{equation}
If the QoI is the field sampled at some locations $\xi_1,\xi_2,\dots,\xi_q$, then $Q^{(h)}:\mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^\beta$ is defined by
\begin{equation}
    Q^{(h)}(u^{(h)}) = \left(u^{(h)}_{j_1},u^{(h)}_{j_2},\dots,u^{(h)}_{j_\beta}\right) \qquad\text{with $\xi_k\in I_{j_k}^{(h)}$ for $k =1,2,\dots,\beta$.}
\end{equation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Solution procedure}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Pure Numerical solution}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given $\alpha^{(h)}$, compute $A^{(h)}=A^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)})$.
\item Solve the linear system in \eqref{eqn:discrete_system} to obtain $u^{(h)}=u^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)})$.
\item Compute the quantity of interest $q^{(h)} = q^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)})= Q^{(h)}(u^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)}))$
\end{enumerate}
This method can be made very accurate by choosing $h\ll1$, but it also becomes very expensive in this case. The computational bottleneck is the solution of  \eqref{eqn:discrete_system}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Pure ML solution}\label{sec:pure_ml}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate a training data set $\{(\alpha^{(h)\ell},q^{(h)\ell})\}_{\ell=1}^{N_{\text{samples}}}$ where for each pair $(\alpha^{(h)\ell},q^{(h)\ell})$ we have that $q^{(h)\ell}=Q^{(h)}(u^{(h)\ell})$ and $u^{(h)\ell}$ satisfies \eqref{eqn:discrete_system}, i.e. 
    \begin{equation}
        A^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)\ell})u^{(h)\ell}=f^{(h)}-\delta^{(h)}
        \qquad\text{for $\ell=1,2,\dots,N_{\text{samples}}$.}
    \end{equation}
    \item Construct a neural network $\Phi_{\text{NN}}$ which is parametrised by some parameters $\theta$
    \begin{equation}
        \Phi_{\text{NN}}(\cdot|\theta) : \mathbb{R}^{n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{\beta}
    \end{equation}
    \item Train the neural network by minimising some loss function $L(\{(\alpha^{(h)\ell},q^{(h)\ell})\}_{\ell=1}^{N_{\text{samples}}}|\theta)$.
For example, one could minimise the average (squared) $L_2$ error:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    L(\{(\alpha^{(h)\ell},q^{(h)\ell})\}_{\ell=1}^{M}|\theta) &= \frac{1}{N_{\text{samples}}}\sum_{\ell=1}^{N_{\text{samples}}} L_2(\alpha^{(h)\ell},q^{(h)\ell}|\theta)\\
    L_2(\alpha^{(h)},q^{(h)}|\theta) &:= \left(\Phi_{\text{NN}}(\alpha^{(h)}|\theta) - q^{(h)}\right)^2
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
If trained properly, $\Phi_{\text{NN}}$ with optimal parameters $\theta_{\text{opt}}$ will give us a good approximation of the quantity of interest for any $\alpha^{(h)}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$:
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_{\text{NN}}(\alpha^{(h)}|\theta_{\text{opt}}) \approx q^{(h)}
\end{equation}
where $q^{(h)}=Q^{(h)}(u^{(h)})$ and $u^{(h)}$ is the solution of $A^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)}) u^{(h)}=f^{(h)}-\delta^{(h)}$.
The problem with this approach is that the neural network is a black box.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Hybrid approach: Physics Enhanced Deep Surrogates (PEDS)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The following approach is described in \cite{pestourie2023physics}:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate a training data set $\{(\alpha^{(h)\ell},q^{(h)\ell})\}_{\ell=1}^{N_{\text{samples}}}$ as in Step 1 of the Pure ML approach in Section \ref{sec:pure_ml}.
    \item Construct a second grid $\Omega_H$ with grid spacing $H=1/N$ consisting of $N<n$ cells. We usually want to choose $H\gg h$.
    \item Define the downsampling operator
    \begin{xalignat}{2}
        R:\mathbb{R}^{n}&\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{N},&
        \alpha^{(h)}&\mapsto \alpha^{(H)}_{\text{DS}}
    \end{xalignat}
    which takes a high-resolution $\alpha^{(h)}$ and turns it into a low-fidelity downsampled $\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{DS}}$. If $H=\mu h$ where the scale parameter $\mu=H/h=n/N\in\mathbb{N}$ is an integer, then we can for example simply set
    \begin{equation}
        (\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{DS}})_j = \alpha^{(h)}_{\mu\cdot j}\qquad\text{for $j=0,1,\dots,N$}.
    \end{equation}
    \item Construct a neural network $\Psi_{\text{NN}}$ parametrised by some parameters $\theta$ (which have nothing to do with the NN parameters in Section \ref{sec:pure_ml})
    \begin{equation}
        \Psi_{\text{NN}}(\cdot|\theta) : \mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{N}.
    \end{equation}
    $\Psi_{\text{NN}}$ maps $\alpha^{(h)}$ to some generated $\alpha_{\text{NN}}^{(H)}$ on the low-resolution grid.
    \item Define some function $A:\mathbb{R}^{N}\times \mathbb{R}^{N}\times [0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{N}$ for combining the downsampled $\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{DS}}$ and the generated $\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{NN}}$ into some $\alpha^{(H)}=A(\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{DS}},\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{NN}},w)$ where $w$ is a learnable parameter. For example, one might choose one of the following two weighted means
    \begin{equation}
        \alpha^{(H)}_j = w (\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{NN}})_j + (1-w) (\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{DS}})_j \qquad\text{for $j=0,1,\dots,N$}
    \end{equation}
    or
    \begin{equation}
        \alpha^{(H)}_j = \log\left(w \exp[(\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{NN}})_j] + (1-w) \exp[(\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{DS}})_j]\right) \qquad\text{for $j=0,1,\dots,N$}
    \end{equation}
    \item For given neural network parameters $\theta$ and weight $w$ define the function $\mathcal{F}^{(h)}_{\text{PEDS}}(\cdot|\theta,w):\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^N$. This function maps a high-resolution $\alpha^{(h)}$ to the low fidelity solution $u^{(H)}=u^{(H)}(\alpha^{(h)})$ as follows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Compute $\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{DS}}$ and $\alpha^{(H)}_{\text{NN}}$ and combine them into $\alpha^{(H)}$ as described above.
        \item Compute the low-fidelity solution $u^{(h)}$ by solving $A^{(H)}(\alpha^{(H)})u^{(H)}=f^{(H)}-\delta^{(H)}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Find optimal $\theta_{\text{opt}}$ and $w_{\text{opt}}$ by minimising some loss function $L(\{(\alpha^{(h)\ell},q^{(h)\ell})\}_{\ell=1}^{N_{\text{samples}}}|\theta)$. Again, the natural choice is to minimise the average (squared) $L_2$ error:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    L(\{(\alpha^{(h)\ell},q^{(h)\ell})\}_{\ell=1}^{M}|\theta) &= \frac{1}{N_{\text{samples}}}\sum_{\ell=1}^{N_{\text{samples}}} L_2(\alpha^{(h)\ell},q^{(h)\ell}|\theta)\\
    L_2(\alpha^{(h)},q^{(h)}|\theta) &:= \left(Q^{(H)}\left(\mathcal{F}_{\text{PEDS}}(\alpha^{(h)}|\theta,w)\right) - q^{(h)}\right)^2
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
If trained properly, $\mathcal{F}_{\text{PEDS}}$ with optimal parameters $\theta_{\text{opt}}$, $w_{\text{opt}}$ will give us a good approximation of the quantity of interest for any $\alpha^{(h)}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$:
\begin{equation}
    Q^{(H)}\left(\mathcal{F}^{(h)}_{\text{PEDS}}(\alpha^{(h)}|\theta_{\text{opt}},w_{\text{opt}})\right) \approx q^{(h)}
\end{equation}
where $q^{(h)}=Q^{(h)}(u^{(h)})$ and $u^{(h)}$ is the solution of $A^{(h)}(\alpha^{(h)}) u^{(h)}=f^{(h)}-\delta^{(h)}$.

\section{Gradients}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We need to back-propagate through the solution, i.e. the map $\alpha\mapsto u$ defined by 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    A(\alpha)u &= f - \delta\\
    u &= A(\alpha)^{-1}(f-\delta)
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where for simplicity we have dropped all superscripts relating to the grid spacing $H$. The chain rule gives:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \alpha_i}=\sum_j\frac{\partial u_j}{\partial \alpha_i}\frac{\partial L}{\partial u_j}
\end{equation}
which leads to
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial\alpha_i} &= \sum_k\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \alpha_i}A(\alpha)^{-1}\right)_{jk}(f_k-\delta_k)  \\
    &=-\left(A(\alpha)^{-1} D_i(\alpha)A(\alpha)^{-1}(f-\delta)\right)_j\qquad\text{with $
    D_i(\alpha):=\frac{\partial \delta}{\partial \alpha_i}(\alpha)$}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The matrix $D_i(\alpha)$ contains mostly zero entries. For $i=0$ it has exactly one non-zero entry, namely $(D_0(\alpha))_{0,0} = 2h^{-1}\exp[\alpha_0]$. For $1<i<N$ it has exactly four non-zero entries namely $(D_i(\alpha))_{i,i}=(D_i(\alpha))_{i-1,i-1}=-(D_i(\alpha))_{i,i-1}=-(D_i(\alpha))_{i-1,i}=h^{-1}\exp[\alpha_i]$.

Further, we can write:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial L}{\partial \alpha_i} = -w^\top D_i(\alpha) u
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{xalignat}{2}
A(\alpha) w &=\frac{\partial L}{\partial u}, &
A(\alpha) u &=f-\delta
\end{xalignat}
